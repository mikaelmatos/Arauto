  "Resumo": "Your digestive system isn’t just for processing food—it’s home to trillions of microbes that produce neurotransmitters like serotonin, directly influencing your mood, memory, and mental clarity. This gut-brain connection means that what you eat can significantly affect how you feel mentally. Adding fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, or kefir and fiber-rich vegetables to your meals can support a healthy gut microbiome, leading to better focus, fewer mood swings, and even reduced anxiety.
