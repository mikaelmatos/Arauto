  "Titulo": "Sleep Like a Scientist The Power of a Consistent Wake-Up Time",
  "Resumo": "Your body loves rhythmâ€”even more than it loves coffee. Waking up at the same time every day (yes, even on weekends) helps regulate your circadian rhythm, which in turn improves sleep quality, energy levels, hormone balance, and even metabolism. Irregular wake-up times can throw off your internal clock, making you feel groggy even after a full night's sleep. Start by setting a consistent wake-up time and let your body thank you with sharper focus and a more stable mood. Share this video, leave your like.",
